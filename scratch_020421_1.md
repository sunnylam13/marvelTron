I had to use:

```
marTron.publicKey = "${{ secrets.MARVEL_APIKEY }}";
```

This uses GitHub Environment Secrets to mask the api key.

I also had to rotate my key from the old one.

The Bitbucket repos do not use this however it may be good practice in the future to only supply the api key as needed during development in real time.
